                <h1>About</h1><hr>
                <p>
                    I am a freshman at the University of Makati, currently taking the undergraduate course
                    of Computer Science Major in Application Development. Back in the day, I've always been intrigued when it comes to applications. It is
                    fascinating to me seeing a vast amount of different softwares with different purposes.
                    </br></br>
                    I have been passionate about programming ever since I knew about it, I've started created small projects in C and C++.
                    I've switched to Java as it was in our learning curriculum in my eleventh grade, to which it became my main language to work on.
                    I've also learned C# as it is mainly the programming language used in Unity, a well-known game engine.

                <h2>Software and Web Development</h2>
                    <p>
                    I specialize in creating the logical structure and its data access and management of the application. I enjoy
                    finding the problems to be fixed by logic and to create a solution for it, optimizing it to make it more efficient is what I find enjoyable.
                    </br></br>
                    While I don't call myself a Frontend Developer, I am still capable of designing the client-side of the application, thinking how 
                    I can make this very understandable for all of the users viewing the application.
                    </p>
                <h2>Game Development</h2>
                    <p>
                    Aside from developing applications for the real world, I also enjoy to create games for entertainment. One of the reasons
                    why programming became my passion is because I wanted to create games just like the games I play in devices. 
                    </br></br>
                    I take heavy inspiration from many of the indie developers as they are capable of creating award-winning games with a very small amount of team
                    despite of the many challenges when it comes to game development.
